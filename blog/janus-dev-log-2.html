    <h2>Janus Dev Log #2: Design and Implementation</h2>

      This series of blog posts is about a mod I'm creating for the video game Factorio and its expansion Space Age. 
      If you don't know what Factorio is see <a href="https://factorio.com/">https://factorio.com/</a>.

    <h3>Design</h3>
    Since the last post I've started better fleshing out the design of the mod.
    Last time I talked about a spoilage loop for the basic resource, which I'm now calling "Shiftite".
    There are now a total of 6 basic forms of Shiftite, labeled as alpha, beta, gamma, delta, epsilon, and zeta (the first 6 letters of the Greek alphabet).
    The spoilage loops are currently designed as:
    <ul>
      <li>alpha &#8594; gamma &#8594; epsilon &#8594; alpha</li>
      <li>beta &#8594; delta &#8594; zeta &#8594; beta</li>
    </ul>
    These resources can then be converted into the 6 base resources needed to launch a rocket in the following manner:
    <ul>
      <li>alpha &#8594; iron</li>
      <li>beta &#8594; copper</li>
      <li>gamma &#8594; stone</li>
      <li>delta &#8594; water</li>
      <li>epsilon &#8594; coal</li>
      <li>zeta &#8594; oil</li>
    </ul>
    Getting the exact resources a base needs requires managing how Shiftite spoils.
    Another way to manage which Shiftite you have involves the "phase change" recipes (unlocked via technology) which gives you access to the recipes:
    <ul>
      <li>alpha + gamma + epsilon &#8594; beta + delta + zeta</li>
      <li>beta + delta + zeta &#8594; alpha + gamma + epsilon</li>
    </ul>
    Next is the science pack.
    The science pack of this planet involves the final forms of Shiftite, omega and psi.
    Shifite Omega is created by combining each of the 6 basic forms of Shiftite.
    Shiftite Omega swaps between Shiftite Psi and itself via spoilage.
    The science pack is created using both omega and psi.

    <p>
      Most of these recipes have to be done in Janus's special building: the Time Distorter.
      In order to unlock this building, you have to visit Janus and mine some Shiftite.
      The planet will also be littered with rocks that contain stone, iron ore, and copper ore so you aren't completely stranded if you forgot to bring resources (similar to Vulcanus).
    </p>
    <p>
      In terms of rewards for making the science pack, currently the rewards are:
      <ul>
        <li>Making more advanced resources (such as processing units) directly from Shiftite;</li>
        <li>Making resources from other planets;</li>
        <li>Duplicating science packs by adding the correct form of Shiftite.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>Implementation</h3>
    <p>
      Implementing these ideas has been a fun and interesting process.
      Factorio mods are written in Lua.
      Currently all this mod is doing is adding what are known as "prototypes" to the game.
      Prototypes are templates for nearly everything in the game.
      So alot of my coding time has been referencing the Factorio Lua API and looking at examples.
      For example, this is the prototype for the recipe that converts Shiftite alpha into iron:
      <pre>
{
  type="recipe",
  name="janus-shiftite-to-iron",
  category="janus-shiftite",
  subgroup="janus-basic-from-shiftite",
  ingredients={{type="item", name="janus-shiftite-alpha", amount=1}},
  results={{type="item", name="iron-plate", amount=20}},
  order="a",
  enabled=false
}
      </pre>
      After writing this code, it appears in game (featuring placeholder graphics):
      <img src="img/dev-log-2-screenshot.png">
      Some things are still in progress with implementation, notably crafting times will still need balancing, which I haven't yet decided upon because I want to fully balance the Time Distorter before that.
      It wouldn't make sense to decide the crafting time if I don't know the crafting speed of the Time Distorter, or what modules I want it to take, etc.
    </p>
    <h3>Release?</h3>
    <p>
      Currently at time of writing (12-8-2024), this mod is not on the mod portal.
      I don't intend on releasing until most of the game elements are in place.
      The main thing I'd like to improve on before releasing is map generation (currently its just Shiftite, no decorations or rocks) and graphics, as most graphics are placeholder.
    </p>
    <h3>Next Time</h3>
    After I get the recipe chains mostly where I want them, I will be focusing primarily on map generation.
    The map generation system is still prototypes, but is quite a bit more complicated than I was expecting, espically compared to adding items and recipes.
    I'll also be working on balancing, since I wanted to get all the recipes layed out before I start balancing.
