    <h2>Blog Development for This Website</h2>

    <p>Website development is difficult.</p>
    <p>
      I learned about the same-origin policy today while trying to develop a personal blog for my website.
      But let's get background on why I learned about this today.
      As a tenet of my website, I'm trying to keep things as simple as possible, so no React, Angular, or any other web dev frameworks.
      Just pure HTML and CSS with hints of Javascript to make changing pages work.
      For the structure of my blog, I figure that each blog post can be its own HTML file for simplicity.
      But in order to view the posts, I need some sort of HTML element that can both a) load HTML files and b) change its contents.
      The best option seemed to be by using an <code>iframe</code>, by changing the <code>src</code> attribute to the particular HTML file I needed.
      I immediately ran into a glaring issue.
    </p>
    <p>
      That issue is that the height of an iframe is not dynamic by default.
      In order to change the height of the iframe I needed Javascript.
      I use Visual Studio Code to develop this website.
      In VS Code there is a built in web preview, which is nice, but doesn't give all the nice web developer tools you can get with F12 in most modern browsers.
      In short (summarizing a good couple hours of debugging and frustration), I figured out that viewing my website through the file directly (<code>file:///path/to/file/index.html</code>) causes an uncaught DOM exception when trying to get the <code>contentWindow.document</code> of the iframe.
      Of course I needed to access <code>contentWindow.document</code> to change the height of the iframe.
      So you can imagine my frustration when it seems to work in the VS Code preview but not in my browser of Firefox.
      Turns out I just needed to host it locally and then navigate to <code>localhost</code> instead of viewing with <code>file://</code>.

    <p><i>Sigh.</i></p>
    <p>
      Anyways, <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48362093/cors-request-blocked-in-locally-opened-html-file" target="_blank">this stackoverflow page</a> is how I <i>finally</i> realized this was the problem.
      And still, this was an educational experience, even if it severly broke my workflow of actually blogging and designing my Factorio mod.
      Oh yea, that's why I wanted to get a blog going in the first place, since I figured writing a dev log for my Factorio mod would be a good way to channel my thoughts and ideas into a place that wasn't just hastily thrown together notes.
      You should see more about that soon.
