        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          Hey there! My name is Xavier Silva.
          Currently I'm job seeking to start my career in tech.
        </p>
        <p>
          I earned my Bachelor of Arts in Mathematics and Computer Science graduating <i>summa cum laude</i> from Kalamazoo College in 2024.
          Some notable projects of mine include my senior thesis on <a href="https://github.com/RochX/virus-research-paper" target="_blank">icosahedral virus transformations</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/RochX/hornethq-2.0-integrated" target="_blank">HornetHQ 2.0 prototype</a> from an advanced software development class (links go to the relevant GitHub repositories).
        </p>
        <p>  
          Beyond the academics, I got involved with numerous music ensembles, though the one the stuck with me the most (and that I still do!) is the art of English Change Ringing.
          In fact, it's such a big part of my life I have a whole page on this website dedicated to it!
        </p>
        <p>
          I also have a hobby in photography, which I picked up from taking a couple of photography classes during college.
          I've put up a few of my best works on this website under the photography page.

      <p>
        Kalamazoo College's Stetson Chapel is home to a set of eight English Change Ringing bells.
        Unlike most church bells within the United States, these bells are meant to rung by a team of people, each person with their own bell.
        The bells are also connected to a wheel, so they rotate a full 360 degrees.
        The gif on this page neatly shows how these bells are rung.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because the bells must make a full rotation between blows, traditional melodies cannot be rung on these bells.
        Instead we ring changes, which are described as a series of mathematical permutations that follow a particular set of rules.
        These rules can be described as follows:
        <ul>
          <li>Each change must include every bell exactly once;</li>
          <li>Each bell cannot move more than one place forward or backwards between changes;</li>
          <li>No change is repeated.</li>
        </ul>
        An example such a sequence of changes is called plain bob minor.
      </p>
      <img class="align-center" style="width:150px" src="img/plainhunton6.gif"/>
      <p>
        One of the most challenging things for ringers to achieve are what are known as quarter peals.
        Quarter peals consist of at least 1,250 permutations such that no permutation is repeated (or is at least repeated the minimal number of times).

        A list of all quarter peals I've ever rung is hosted on the BellBoard: <a href="https://bellboard.uk/search.php?ringer=Xavier+Silva">https://bellboard.uk/search.php?ringer=Xavier+Silva</a>
